        <h2>Industrial Precision Refined Artistry</h2>
        <p class="recantation">"Global capitalism is nearly there. At the end of the world there will only be liquid advertisement and gaseous desire. Sublimated from our bodies, our untethered senses will endlessly ride escalators through pristine artificial environments, more and less than human, drugged-up and drugged down, catalyzed, consuming and consumed by a relentlessly rich economy of sensory information, valued by the pixel.

            "R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-Right about now..." the deep dish surround-sounditorium rumbled with a low-thud membrane shaking 130 bpm rhythm & shred-edited human
            language. G closed his eyes and pushed his way thru the tightly packed dance area of his penthouse barracks, out safely to the terrace.

            His party would be reviewed tomorrowas one of the top 5 ways to have spent the last 15 minutes of the century. He had personally spent every free
            moment of the past month arrangin & preparing for it. Admittedly, that only added up to about 10 minutes, but luckily it was easier to do more in less
