                Hello World! My name is George and I am a third year student at the University of California San Diego. 
                I am interested in computer science - more specifically the web with a focus on studying how end users perceive
                the internet. To complement the technical toolkit of a web developer I am also focused on product marketing. My
                current goals are to develop a holistic approach to software development and to bring my knowledge with me to a 
                California startup that is looking for a passionate developer with a robust understanding not only of how the web
                works but also how the end-user perceives the software that we as developers craft for them. I am also deeply 
                passionate about electronic music history.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am an avid learner with a variety of interests spanning application development, processor design, and digital audio. 
                My energetic and enthusiastic personality really comes alive in team environments where I can build interpersonal 
                relationships among members and help guide the team to success. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I am comfortable with most mainline web dev technologies including Javascript, HTML, CSS along with technologies like Docker and 
                GitHub all of which I have integrated into projects for various classes and personal projects. I am also comfortable writing native 
                code with C++, Java, and Python in addition to 32-bit variants of ARM and MIPS assembly.
